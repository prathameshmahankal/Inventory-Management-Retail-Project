# Inventory-Management-Retail-Project

In this project, I will be working on optimizing the process for a retail store where I used work for my on-campus job.

The project aims a solving the two problems faced by the store:
* __Inventory Management__ -
The goal is to optimize the inventory management process and forcast the sale of certain products such that no food gets wasted at the end of the day. Ordering items upto a quantity that is required will also result in more profits for the store.
* __Reducing the customer wait-time and prevent employee fatigue__ -
The goal here is to perform time series analysis by analyzing the number of customers visiting the store at different times of the day and thus making sure that there are enough employees working in that shift such that the customers don't have to wait for long in the queue and the employees working in that shift are not subjected to more pressure than they can handle.
